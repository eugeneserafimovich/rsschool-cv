function  disc(discount){
	clientDiscount = clientSpentToday * discount / 100
	clientSpentToday = clientSpentToday - clientDiscount
	console.log(clientDiscount)
	alert(`You get a discount on ${discount}%`);
	alert(`Thanks, ${clientInfo}! To pay ${clientSpentToday}$`)
	clientSpentForAllTime = clientSpentToday + clientSpentForAllTime

}

if (clientSpentForAllTime >= 100 && clientSpentForAllTime < 300 ) {
